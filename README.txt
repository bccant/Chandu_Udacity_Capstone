Chandu_Trails_UdacityCapstone:

Trailing App with the map options

This was as part of my capstone project for Udacity's Android Nano degree. The app shows the list of states in the form of famous pictures from the 50 states of USA and also in the form of a drop down spinner list.

The user can also search for an address and get the list of trails near his/her address. This search is provided by Google's places fragment.

The trails details can be sorted based on the distance from the selected place (the default option), length of the trail and the trail difficulty.

Once selected, the trails details like it's image, condition details and link is provided. The hovering fab button allows the user to see the address of the trail in maps. Two markers are provided: one for the selected address (shown as Home) and another one for the trail address.

The images from the app are as below:
